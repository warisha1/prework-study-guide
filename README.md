# Prework Study Guide For Bootcamp Students

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Continuing my education through this after a long gap and finding myself a worthy field was my biggest motivation. I built this project because it helped me bridged the gap of my knowledge with updated industry needs and get me on the trackl for bootcamp. Throughout the project using html,css,git, javascript helped me not only built a website but also learn the debugging in the process and links of related blogs advanced the knowlegde about what and why I'm doing every step along the way.
